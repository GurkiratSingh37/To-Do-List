1.1 - I'm trying to add mongodb configuration in todolist. The only issue is that in 'todoService.js' the logic written is for mysql i.e.
    when user tries to create a task then it check id it already available in the list or not which I don't think is neccessary but
    we'll try to change the mongodb code accordingly.
